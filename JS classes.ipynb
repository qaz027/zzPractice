Imagine building houses; each house shares a similar structure — doors, windows, a roof, rooms — but the details may vary, such as the number of rooms or doors. Similarly, each object of a class will have a consistent structure, but the details may differ."

    "In this example, when a new instance of Dog named Spot is created, it first logs \"An instance of Dog is being created\", then super(name) calls the Animal constructor, which logs \"An instance of Animal is being created\". When Spot speaks, it calls the parent's speak method, outputting \"Spot makes a noise.\", then it adds its own message, \"Spot barks.\". This demonstrates how Dog instances inherit properties and methods from both the Dog and the Animal class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, Cat does not have its own constructor or speak method, so it fully relies on the inherited constructor and method from Animal. Thus, a new Cat instance like whiskers shows only \"An instance of Animal is being created\" and when we call whiskers.speak(), it only outputs \"Whiskers makes a noise.\". This highlights how a subclass can fully adopt a superclass's features when it does not define its own.\n",
