    "Welcome to the next step in our journey of building a chatbot service with Flask. In the previous lesson, we focused on the ChatController, which manages chat sessions and handles messages by interacting with both the model and service layers. Now, we will take a significant step forward by creating a RESTful API for our chatbot service using Flask. We'll start by setting up the main Flask application, then adapt the ChatController to integrate with Flask's session management.\n",
