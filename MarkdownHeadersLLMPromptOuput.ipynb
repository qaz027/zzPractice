    "# Lesson: Markdown Headers in Output Formatting\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson equips prompt engineers with techniques for directing LLMs to produce outputs structured with markdown headers. The goal is to enhance response readability and organization through precise prompt crafting. Also, using markdown headers in your output can make parsing output much easier.\n",
    "Key Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "The success in generating markdown header-formatted outputs lies in the explicit instruction within your prompts as well as in providing examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive directly into examples demonstrating how to incorporate markdown header formatting instructions into your prompts.\n",
    "Basic Prompt Without Formatting Request:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you are writing a biology report and want to collaborate with an LLM in doing so but you want your report to be nicely structured in markdown. Your initial prompt might be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "__ASK__\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe the process of photosynthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This prompt will yield a narrative or list, lacking structured hierarchy.\n",
    "Enhanced Prompt With Formatting Request:\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "__ASK__\n",
    "\n",
    "Outline the process of photosynthesis using markdown headers for each main step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__FORMAT EXAMPLE__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Photosynthesis Process\n",
    "\n",
    "## Light Absorption\n",
    "\n",
    "Description...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Carbon Dioxide Fixation\n",
    "\n",
    "Description...\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "By including a clear formatting request and a structural example, the prompt is more likely to elicit a response that is well-organized and easy to navigate.\n",
    "Advanced Structuring:\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you only want to use a specific header like an h2 type header (in markdown that's ##) instead of the variety that is produced by the prompt above?\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "__ASK__\n",
    "\n",
    "Detail the journey of a red blood cell through the human body using markdown headers for each organ system it passes through.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__CONSTRAINTS__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only use h2 type headers (`##`) in the markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also include markdown tables for better information organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__FORMAT EXAMPLE__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Journey of a Red Blood Cell\n",
    "\n",
    "## Heart\n",
    "\n",
    "## Right Atrium to Right Ventricle\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lungs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gas Exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "This prompt demonstrates how adding a constraints section can make your desired output even more controlled.\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Crafting prompts that lead to markdown header-organized responses is straightforward but requires explicit formatting requests. Experiment with different levels of header specifications to achieve the desired depth of information structuring. Mastery comes with practice, and the precision in your prompts will yield increasingly structured and useful outputs from LLMs."

    "## Photosynthesis Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules. This complex process primarily occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Light Absorption\n",
    "\n",
    "During photosynthesis, chlorophyll pigments absorb light energy, primarily in the blue and red wavelengths, and convert it into chemical energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Photosystems and Chlorophyll\n",
    "\n",
    "Photosynthesis involves two main photosystems: Photosystem I (PSI) and Photosystem II (PSII). Chlorophyll, the key pigment, plays a crucial role in capturing light energy and initiating the electron transport process.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Photosystem | Function |\n",
    "|-------------|----------|\n",
    "| PSI | Absorbs light at 700 nm, facilitating electron transfer to NADP+. |\n",
    "| PSII | Absorbs light at 680 nm, generating oxygen by splitting water molecules. |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Water Splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Water molecules are split into oxygen, protons, and electrons in a process known as photolysis. This occurs in PSII and contributes to the oxygen we breathe.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Electron Transport Chain\n",
    "\n",
    "Electrons energized by light absorption move through a series of proteins known as the electron transport chain (ETC), creating a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ATP and NADPH Formation\n",
    "\n",
    "The proton gradient drives ATP synthesis through ATP synthase, while electrons reduce NADP+ to NADPH.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Molecule | Purpose |\n",
    "|----------|---------|\n",
    "| ATP | Provides energy for the Calvin Cycle. |\n",
    "| NADPH | Supplies reducing power for carbon fixation. |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calvin Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "The Calvin Cycle, also known as the light-independent reactions or the dark reactions, occurs in the stroma of chloroplasts and uses ATP and NADPH generated in the light-dependent reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Carbon Fixation\n",
    "\n",
    "Carbon dioxide is fixed into organic molecules through the enzyme RuBisCO, forming 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reduction Phase\n",
    "\n",
    "ATP and NADPH are used to convert 3-PGA into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), a carbohydrate precursor.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Phase | Input | Output |\n",
    "|-------|-------|--------|\n",
    "| Carbon Fixation | CO₂, RuBP | 3-PGA |\n",
    "| Reduction | ATP, NADPH | G3P |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regeneration of RuBP\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the G3P molecules are used to regenerate RuBP, enabling the cycle to continue. This process also consumes ATP.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Factors Affecting Photosynthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate of photosynthesis is influenced by several environmental factors, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Light Intensity**: More light increases the rate to a certain point.\n",
    "- **Carbon Dioxide Concentration**: Higher CO₂ levels can enhance photosynthesis.\n",
    "- **Temperature**: Extreme temperatures can denature enzymes, affecting the rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Factor | Effect |\n",
    "|--------|--------|\n",
    "| Light Intensity | Increases rate until a saturation point. |\n",

    "Interphase is the cell cycle phase where the cell prepares for mitosis. Though not a part of mitosis itself, it is crucial for a successful division. This phase is characterized by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **G1 Phase (Growth 1):** Cell grows and carries out normal functions.\n",
    "- **S Phase (Synthesis):** DNA replication occurs, doubling the genetic material.\n",

    "Metaphase is marked by the alignment of chromosomes along the metaphase plate, an imaginary line equidistant between the spindle’s two poles. Key events include:\n",

    "- Formation of a cell plate in plant cells, which develops into a separating wall.\n",
