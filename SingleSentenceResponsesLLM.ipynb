    "# Lesson: Going From a Single Word To a Single Sentence\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson focuses on crafting prompts to obtain single-sentence summaries, specifically in the context of financial market trends. By using the example of summarizing stock market trends, our objective is to fine-tune our prompts so that the LLM provides us with a concise, informative sentence that captures the essence of the market's current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single-sentence summaries are crucial for financial analysts and investors who require a quick understanding of market sentiment without delving into detailed reports.\n",
    "The Challenge of Single-Sentence Summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasking LLMs to distill complex information like financial market data into a single sentence is challenging. LLMs tend to provide detailed explanations or multiple viewpoints, which, while beneficial for understanding, may not be ideal for those needing quick insights.\n",

    "\n",
    "Refining Prompts for Concise Market Summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "To guide the LLM towards delivering a one-sentence summary, we must be explicit about our constraints and what we expect in the response. It involves directly specifying the desired length and depth of analysis.\n",

    "Refine this prompt to ensure it produces a single-sentence summary of the given financial market situation, focusing specifically on the impact of a certain event.\n",
    "\n",
    "__ASK__\n",
    "Summarize the impact of the latest Federal Reserve interest rate hike on the stock market today.\n",
    "\n",
    "__CONTEXT__\n",
    "The stock market's reaction to the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate hike presented a complex picture, with investor sentiments divided across different sectors. On one hand, the technology and healthcare sectors exhibited remarkable resilience, buoyed perhaps by the anticipation of continued demand and innovation despite the broader economic tightening. Companies within these sectors seemed to leverage their robust growth prospects and strong balance sheets to weather the uncertainty brought about by the interest rate adjustments. Investors in these areas appeared to focus on long-term growth opportunities, undeterred by the immediate ripples of monetary policy changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, the general market trended downwards in the wake of the announcement, reflecting widespread concerns over higher borrowing costs and their potential to slow down economic growth. Sectors more sensitive to interest rate hikes, such as real estate and consumer discretionary, felt the brunt of the market's apprehension. For these industries, the increased cost of financing could dampen consumer spending and investment in development projects, thereby hindering growth. This divergence highlights the nuanced impact of monetary policy on different areas of the economy, with some sectors positioned to navigate the challenges more adeptly than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mixed response also underscores the broader uncertainty pervading the market as investors grapple with the implications of the Federal Reserve's strategy to combat inflation. While the central bank aims to temper price increases by making borrowing more expensive, the risk of inadvertently triggering a slowdown looms large. As such, market participants are keenly watching for signs of how these monetary adjustments will affect consumer behavior, corporate earnings, and ultimately, the trajectory of economic growth. In this environment, the divergent sectoral performances serve as a reminder of the complex interplay between monetary policy, investor sentiment, and economic fundamentals.\n",

    "Explain the effect of a specific code optimization on program performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "__CONTEXT__\n",
    "Optimizing a program's performance through code refinements can significantly alter its execution dynamics. A common illustration is the enhancement of recursive functions, such as the calculation of Fibonacci numbers, by integrating memoization techniques. Without optimization, a naive recursive approach to computing Fibonacci numbers suffers from a severe inefficiency—exponential time complexity—due to the repeated computation of the same values. By introducing memoization, which stores and reuses the results of expensive function calls, the algorithm's efficiency improves dramatically from exponential to linear time complexity. This adjustment drastically reduces the number of computations needed to arrive at a result, thereby enhancing the program's execution speed. Memoization effectively addresses the fundamental problem of unnecessary repetition in recursive calculations, turning a potentially sluggish operation into a swift and efficient process. This transformation underscores the power of algorithmic optimization in programming and the specific impact of memoization on improving recursive functions' performance.\n",
