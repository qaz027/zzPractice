    "# Lesson: Mastering Single-Word Responses From LLMs\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we're turning our attention to a specific technique of getting single-word output from LLMs. We'll use the example of designing an AI tutor that provides verdicts on code correctness. Our goal is to refine our prompts so that this AI tutor can succinctly report whether a piece of code is correct with a single word: \"True\" for correct and \"False\" for incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting a single-word output, in this case, is important cause you can parse it out to use in the rest of your AI tutor development work.\n",
    "The Challenge of Obtaining Binary Verdicts\n",
    "\n",
    "When we task LLMs with evaluating code, the natural inclination of these models is to provide detailed feedback, explanations, or even corrected versions of the code. However, for an AI tutor scenario, we need it to distill its evaluation into a binary choice—correct or incorrect. Mastering this prompt design challenges us to direct the LLM's focus away from its propensity for elaboration towards a stark, binary output.\n",

    "To ensure we receive a \"True\" or \"False\" response regarding the correctness of a code snippet, clarity and specificity are key in our prompts.
