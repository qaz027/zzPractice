    "\n",
    "Hello there! Today, we are venturing into an exploration of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), a language that contributes endlessly to bringing color, life, and structure to webpages. Think about this: once you have constructed a building with bare walls with HTML, CSS becomes the tool that paints the walls, decorates the room, and makes it cozy. Amazing, isn't it? Let's dive in!\n",
    "Basic Syntax of CSS\n",

    "    In HTML, elements are often enclosed within other elements. The enclosing element is called the parent element, and the enclosed elements are known as child elements. In the above example, the div element is a parent element to the h2 and p child elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Block-level Elements: By default, a block-level element starts on a new line, causes a line break after itself, and expands to fill the full width of its parent element. <div>, <p>, and <h1> through <h6> are some examples. Though these elements behave this way by default, their behavior can be modified using advanced CSS techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inline Elements: On the other hand, inline elements do not start on a new line and do not cause a line break after them. They take up only as much width as necessary for their content. Multiple inline elements can be placed next to each other on the same line. Examples of inline elements include <span>, <a>, <img>, etc.\n",

Add style for your stars div through the class selector, setting background color black and text color white. Color the h1 element orange to make it stand out in your space-themed page.
