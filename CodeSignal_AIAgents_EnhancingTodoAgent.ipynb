    "# Lesson Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! In this lesson, we’ll enhance our **Todo API agent** to support all **CRUD operations**: `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, and `Delete`. These are the core actions behind any data-driven app, from simple to-do lists to complex systems. By the end, you’ll know how to implement and orchestrate these operations in a Python agent that communicates with a RESTful API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of building a digital assistant for daily tasks. To be useful, it must add, show, update, and remove tasks. CRUD operations make this possible. Our goal is to make our Todo agent handle all these actions smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** In this lesson, we focus on implementing the client side of the Todo API agent — that is, the code that sends requests to an API to perform CRUD operations. The lesson does not cover the implementation of the API server that receives and responds to these requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overview of CRUD Operations and Data Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "CRUD stands for `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, and `Delete` — the four basic ways to manage data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Create**: Add a new item (e.g., a new task).\n",
    "- **Read**: Retrieve items (e.g., list all tasks).\n",
    "- **Update**: Change an item (e.g., mark a task as done).\n",
    "- **Delete**: Remove an item (e.g., delete a finished task).\n",
    "\n",
    "In web apps, these map to HTTP methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `POST` for Create\n",
    "- `GET` for Read\n",
    "- `PUT` for Update\n",
    "- `DELETE` for Delete\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, adding a new task in a to-do app sends a `POST` request. Viewing tasks uses `GET`. Editing uses `PUT`, and deleting uses `DELETE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To manage tasks, we use data models. Our agent uses **Pydantic** models to define a task and the required arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the task model:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pydantic import BaseModel\n",
    "\n",
    "class TodoItem(BaseModel):\n",
    "    id: int                # Unique task identifier\n",
    "    title: str             # Task name\n",
    "    done: bool             # Completion status (True if done, False otherwise)\n",
    "    description: str       # Task details\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `id`: Unique task identifier.\n",
    "- `title`: Task name.\n",
    "- `done`: Completion status.\n",
    "- `description`: Task details.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use an `Enum` to specify the action:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from enum import Enum\n",
    "from typing import Optional\n",
    "\n",
    "class Action(str, Enum):\n",
    "    GET = \"get\"            # Read operation\n",
    "    POST = \"post\"          # Create operation\n",
    "    PUT = \"put\"            # Update operation\n",
    "    DELETE = \"delete\"      # Delete operation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We wrap the action and task together:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class TodoItemArgs(BaseModel):\n",
    "    action: Action                 # The CRUD action to perform\n",
    "    task: Optional[TodoItem] = None  # The task to operate on (if needed)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure lets us clearly state what to do and with which task.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Implementing CRUD in the TodoAPI Class: Read and Create\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TodoAPI` class handles API communication. Each CRUD operation is a class method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Read (GET):**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `get_tasks` method is the same as in the previous lesson—a quick revision:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "def get_tasks(cls):\n",
    "    # Send a GET request to fetch all tasks\n",

    "- Sends `DELETE` to remove a task by ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dispatching Actions:**\n",

    "# Integrating CRUD with the Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s connect these CRUD operations to our agent so it can process natural language commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wrap the API logic in a `FunctionTool`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "todos_api_tool = FunctionTool(\n",
