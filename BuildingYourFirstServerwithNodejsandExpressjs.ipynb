    "# Lesson: Introducing Node.js\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! Let's embark on a journey into server-side programming, starting with Node.js.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we pound the pavement, let's briefly define two core terms of web communication: server and client. You can think of the server as a chef - it prepares (serves) data or information. The client, on the other hand, is like a restaurant guest - it requests and receives this information and renders it on the web page. Together, they carry out web interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, back to Node.js. So, what exactly is Node.js? It's a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which allows you to run JavaScript on your computer. In other words, it enables you to use JavaScript outside of a browser! With Node.js, you can interact with your computer's file system much as you would with other server-side languages such as PHP or Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dancing with Express.js\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's explore Express.js. It's a flexible Node.js web application framework that offers a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Although the name might sound intimidating, rest assured that it's a user-friendly library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Express.js enables us to manage everything, from API routes to requests and views. It's incredibly adaptable and pluggable, providing everything we need straight out of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Express.js in your application, just require the \"express\" module in a Node.js file as shown below:"

We then create an instance of Express by calling the express() function, which returns our app. The app object possesses several methods, one of which is the get() method, which defines a route handler for HTTP GET requests. In this case, we are defining a route handler for the root path ('/') that responds with the string \"Hello World!\" whenever it receives a GET request. Finally, we start our server on the defined port by calling the listen() method on our app.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
