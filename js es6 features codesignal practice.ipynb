    "Introduction to JavaScript ES6+ Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to an engaging session on JavaScript ES6+! JavaScript ES6+ marks an evolution from the original JavaScript language - the ECMAScript standard. Debuting as ECMAScript 2015 (ES2015 or ES6) and continuing with subsequent releases (ES7, ES8, ES9, and so on), ES6+ has provided a rich set of advanced features and syntax improvements. These enhancements have streamlined coding practices, making JavaScript more concise, efficient, and readable. Today, you will master these transformative features: Arrow functions, Spread operator, Destructuring, and Template strings. Through the use of practical examples, you will learn how these features revolutionize the process of writing efficient JavaScript code.\n",
