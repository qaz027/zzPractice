    "Personalizing AI's Behavior with System Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the next step in your journey of creating a chatbot with OpenAI! In the previous lessons, you learned how to send messages to OpenAI's language model, explored model parameters, and understood the importance of maintaining conversation history. Now, we will focus on personalizing your AI by using system prompts. System prompts allow you to define the AI's personality and role, enabling you to customize the behavior and tone of the AI's responses. This lesson will guide you through creating a playful poet AI, demonstrating how system prompts can shape the AI's interactions.\n",
    "Creating a System Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "A system prompt is a key tool for customizing the AI's behavior, setting the stage for how it interacts with users. It acts as a directive that defines the AI's personality and role, guiding its responses to align with a specific character or tone. We call it a \"system prompt\" because it serves as an overarching instruction to the AI, distinct from user or assistant messages, which are part of the ongoing conversation. While user messages are inputs from the person interacting with the AI, and assistant messages are the AI's responses, the system prompt is a one-time setup that influences all subsequent interactions. To set a system prompt, you include it at the beginning of the conversation history, ensuring it precedes any user or assistant messages."
