    "Setting Up the Basic Chat Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first lesson of our course on developing a chatbot web application. In this lesson, we will focus on setting up a basic chat interface using Flask and HTML. This is an essential step in creating a user-friendly web application that enhances the user experience. A well-designed interface is crucial for engaging users and ensuring they can interact with the chatbot seamlessly. This lesson builds on the previous courses, where you created a chat application using OpenAI and Flask. Now, we will add a graphical interface to make it more accessible and visually appealing.\n",
    "Flask and HTML Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature of Flask is its ability to serve HTML templates, which form the backbone of your application's user interface. These templates are stored in the templates directory and are rendered using the render_template function. This function takes the name of an HTML file as an argument and returns the rendered HTML to the client, allowing for dynamic content delivery.\n",

    "Let's explore the main.py file to see how HTML pages are rendered in our Flask application."

This approach not only enhances the user experience but also sets the stage for more complex interactions as we build out the chatbot's functionality.\n",
