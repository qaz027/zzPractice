    "# Lesson: Mastering the Art of Style in AI Prompting\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will explore how to communicate effectively with Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve specific stylistic outcomes in our prompts. Mastering this skill is crucial for crafting prompts that generate more tailored, precise, and consistent results. Whether your goal is to create professional documents, imaginative stories, or anything in between, understanding style specifications will enhance your prompt engineering capabilities.\n",
    "Understanding Style Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine style specification as the process of giving instructions to a highly skilled chef. As you would specify your wish for your steak's doneness, you can guide LLMs in producing the \"flavor\" of text you desire. The style can encompass various elements, including tone (formal, informal), language (simple, technical), and length (brief, detailed), among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "__ASK__\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate a motivational quote for a team newsletter. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__STYLE__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tone: uplifting and visionary. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Language: simple and accessible. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Length: short.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"In every challenge lies an opportunity to grow stronger together. Let's embrace our journey with courage and unite our efforts toward a future filled with success. Remember, the strength of the team is each individual member, and the strength of each member is the team.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If you simply remove the Length: short part from the prompt you get a noticeably different output:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. Let's harness our collective strengths, dreams, and ambitions. Every challenge we face is an opportunity to grow stronger, together. Remember, it's not just about reaching the top; it's about the journey we share and the bonds we build. Let's move forward, hand in hand, towards our shared vision. Because when we unite, there's nothing we can't achieve.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Role of Tone in Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Tone plays a significant role in determining the perception of your prompts and the type of responses you receive. Setting an explicit tone helps guide the LLM towards generating responses that align with the emotional or professional context you aim for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "__ASK__\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a brief overview of renewable energy sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__STYLE__\n",
    "\n",
    "Tone: Informative but easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tone instruction in this example prompts the LLM to balance professional information delivery with accessibility, ensuring that the content is not too technical for the audience.\n",
    "Language and Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to specify the language and complexity of the desired output, especially when the levels of expertise in your audience vary widely. This specification might entail requesting responses in either simple or technical language, depending on your target readers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "__ASK__\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain how solar panels convert sunlight into electricity. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__STYLE__\n",
    "\n",
    "Language: Simple, for a general audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "This prompt instructs the LLM to use layman's terms, thereby making a complex technology understandable to those without a technical background.\n",
    "Length and Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, specifying the length and level of detail can substantially influence the effectiveness of your communication. This process may involve requesting concise summaries or detailed explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "__ASK__\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarize the benefits of using electric vehicles. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__STYLE__\n",
    "\n",
    "Length: Brief, two sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how in the Length section we got very specific about the length with two sentences since sometimes short or long can be relative and hard to understand.\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding and leveraging style specifications can be a powerful tool in the design and development of prompts. Much like a sculptor chisels away to reveal the form within, specifying style in your prompts helps shape the output into the precise form you envision.\n",
    "\n",
    "And look at that, you are almost done with this course ready to chart your way as a Prompt Engineer. I am sure there is still much to learn but this course should establish a strong foundation to guide you on that journey. Before we call it done, let's do a few more practices."

    "# Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhance the given prompt to generate a compelling short story that embodies a futuristic setting with a theme of unity overcoming adversity. Note that we've added some other potential stylistic attributes you can use that weren't covered in the lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prompt\n",
    "__ASK__\n",
    "Write a short story\n",
    "\n",
    "__STYLE__\n",
    "- Tone: compelling and captivating\n",

    "# Output\n",
    "In the year 2147, the world stood divided. Boundaries drawn from ancient conflicts and new technological differences created invisibly towering walls between nations. Yet, unseen under the silencing glass dome of Thalassa, amidst the vastness of the Atlantic Ocean, there emerged a hope—a city known not for its prosperity, but for its humanity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thalassa was a marvel of engineering, floating seamlessly between two continents, North America and Europe, with gleaming towers reaching for the heavens. Its inhabitants came from every corner of the globe, each leaving the tensions of their homelands in pursuit of a dream—a unified world. Here, they forged community from diversity, learning, and adapting amidst the shared hum of their collective heartbeat. Beneath its luminescent streets, the city's power ran on the ocean's continuous ebb and flow, a testament to nature’s perpetual cycle of unity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heart of Thalassa was the Agora, a pulsating hub where diverse languages blended into a harmonious symphony. It was here that Anya—an astute engineer who hailed from the mountains of Siberia—and Tariq—a visionary diplomat from Cairo—often met. Together, they worked on Project Nereus, an initiative designed to extend Thalassa's ethos of unity beyond its borders, reaching every divided corner of Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anya’s eyes sparkled with determination as she adjusted her holo-tablet, displaying blueprints that danced across thin air. “If we can channel tidal energy into more sustainable forms, we might just light the path for nations drowning in darkness—those without resources, holed up behind walls of suspicion.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Tariq nodded, his voice infused with the excitement of a thousand dreams ready to burst forth. “Once the dominoes fall, others will have no choice but to follow. Imagine an energy grid that respects no borders. It would truly undivide us.”\n",
    "\n",
    "But their vision was not without opposition. The shadowed conglomerates of old-world power, deeply threatened by this rising unity, sought to dismantle Thalassa’s ideals before they could spread. They sent emissaries—charismatic, persuasive—to sow seeds of doubt, whispering of chaos, loss of identity, and the phantoms of ancient enmities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The day of decision approached, a summit where the world would witness the inauguration of Project Nereus. The Agora thrummed with agents and citizens alike, tension mingling with hope. Anya and Tariq stood on the dais, silhouettes against a backdrop of luminous maps tracing Thalassa's energy paths across oceans and continents.\n",
    "\n",
    "As spirits lifted in anticipation, clouds gathered in the form of black ships on the horizon, sent by adversaries to disrupt the gathering. A hush descended, a fear of doors closing once more, futures extinguishing. But against despair, a spirit of unity rose.\n",
    "\n",
    "The citizens of Thalassa, hand in hand, blueprints in hand, ideas in hand, stood as one. Anya and Tariq, with magnetic resolve, addressed the crowd and the world. “They believe they can divide us, but they underestimate the power of united purpose. Look to your neighbor. Know them. Trust them. Together, we are not simply a city; we ARE the message,” Anya proclaimed, her voice carrying the resolve of the hopeful.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that electrifying moment, the black ships hesitated and then drifted back, dissolved by the unwavering strength of thousands standing united as one. And as the sun dipped below the horizon, Thalassa illuminated not just the sea, but the hearts and minds of a world ready for change, a world ready to embrace unity and, through it, overcome adversity."

    "\n",
    "**Emma:** *(sipping her luminescent amber latte)* It's fascinating, isn't it? Even in a place like this, where everything is automated, it feels so... normal. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Liam:** *(nodding)* It really is. I remember when people thought AI-run cafes were something out of a sci-fi novel. Now, it feels like they’ve always been part of our daily routine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Emma:** True, and every interaction here is seamless. Last time, I asked the AI bartender for a recommendation, and it suggested this drink based on my previous orders. It's like it knows me better than I know myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Liam:** That’s AI for you. The integration into everyday life has been gradual, but it’s quietly revolutionized how we do almost everything. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Emma:** Do you ever worry about how dependent we are becoming? I mean, what if it goes under the radar and suddenly we’re in a world we don't recognize?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Liam:** It’s definitely something to consider. The key is in implementing checks and balances—ensuring AI systems are transparent and ethical. I work on a team that’s developing AI protocols, and trust me, ethical considerations are always on the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Emma:** That’s reassuring to hear. I sometimes think about how AI affects our jobs, identity, and even relationships. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Liam:** Yeah, AI adds layers we haven’t fully explored yet. Like, how does AI change what it means to connect with each other? When a machine can make your coffee, recommend your next book, or even compose a personalized song for you, where do we draw the line for intimacy?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Emma:** That’s a profound thought. Reminds me of the class I’m taking on AI in Philosophy. We discuss the moral status of AI and whether they can ever possess consciousness or should be treated as moral agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Liam:** I’d love to sit in on one of those lectures. It aligns with what I often ponder—if AI becomes sophisticated enough to make complex decisions akin to human reasoning, what rights would or should they have?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Emma:** It’s a Pandora’s box, for sure. But cafes like this, they’re a glimpse into our potential future, showing us both the perks and ethical dilemmas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Liam:** Exactly. And while we enjoy our smart lattes and robotically delivered pastries, it’s important to keep questioning and exploring the implications. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Emma:** *(smiles)* Let’s promise to meet here again in a year and see where AI has taken us. Who knows, maybe by then, the entire conversation could be facilitated by AI!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Liam:** Now, that would be something. But until then, I’m glad we can enjoy the human touch in our dialogue... even if we’re surrounded by androids.\n",
