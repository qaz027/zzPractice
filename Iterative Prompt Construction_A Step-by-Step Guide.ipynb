    "# Lesson: Iterative Prompt Construction: A Step-by-Step Guide\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the subsequent step in mastering prompt engineering with Large Language Models (LLMs): Iterative Prompt Construction. Through iterative refinement, we can transform our initial, high-level questions into more precise prompts which yield exactly the outputs we need. Let's delve into how we can utilize this technique.\n",
    "Understanding Iterative Prompt Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind iterative prompt construction is to start from a simple prompt and use LLM output to enhance your prompt instead of writing the whole prompt from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, complex prompts require formatting guidelines, comprehensive examples, detailed requirements and much more. Doing it all from scratch could be a daunting task. This is where starting simple and using your initial outputs to iteratively enhance and improve your prompt becomes handy.\n",
    "The Starting Point\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s assume we want to build a comprehensive prompt for returning JSON documents from bulleted lists. Creating the full prompt from scratch might take some time but in collaboration with an LLM to build it iteratively we can do it much faster.\n",

Also, in case the initial result we got wasn't exactly what we had in mind, we could make some manual tweaks to get it exactly where we need it.\n",
