    "\n",
    "    CSS Box Model: Think of every piece on your website as a box. The Box Model is what we use in CSS to manage where each box goes, how much space it takes up, and how it interacts with other boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Flexbox: Sometimes, we want what's in the boxes to adjust itself nicely. This is where Flexbox comes in. Using Flexbox, we can control how elements inside a box align and order themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Grid: If we want to lay out our boxes in a grid, like a table or a chessboard, the Grid system is the tool we use. It makes complex designs simple, letting us quickly decide what goes in which row or column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what we'll learn in this course:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Understand the CSS Box Model and its role in organizing your website.\n",
    "    Master the CSS flexbox and grid systems, becoming pro at how they manage boxes.\n",
    "    Practice using these systems to build neat and well-structured web pages.\n",
